 ------"A simple python code to create a db in mongodb."-----
 
 Import pymongo.
  create a client. Building connection
 Client=pymongo.MongoClient(‘mongodb:// 127.0.0.1:27107/’)
                                                    (‘ protocol://ipaddress:local host name’)
 creating a dbatabse in mongodb from here.
 Mydb=client[‘employee’] # in the client, planning to create a database by the name ‘employee’.
 we need to create a collection(table)
 collectn=mydb.employee_info        # employee_info is the table name
 let us store record into it.
 records must be in dictionary format/json format.
 record={ “Name”: ‘XYZ’,
 	  “ Age”:27,
 	  “Gender”: ‘M’
 	}
 collectn.insert_one(record) # inserting one record. 
 Note the insert syntax.	
 record1={ “Name”: ‘ABC’,
 	  “ Age”:29,
 	  “Gender”: ‘F’
 	}
 collectn.insert_one(record1) # inserting one record. Note the insert syntax	   
6. If it runs without error, goto mongo CLI and show the dbs and check it.
7. You may also check the same in the compass GUI.



Import mongo json file.
1. We need to check if the IMPORT tool is active in mongo.
2. Visit: www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools
3. Download available MongoDB Database tools.
4. Unzip or extract the same into the mongodb…bin
5. Open a terminal and check mongoimport is available.
6. From the web download a json file for a collection. Or copy this into your system and unzip it. ( I may share it)
7. To download a json file into mongodb,Type:
   Mongoipmort –db dbname –collection collection_name – file the Jason file name along with path 
8. To check if it imported correctly.. goto mongo and  show dbs;
   Show collections;
   Db.collectionname.find() display all the records in the table.
